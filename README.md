## Notes

This project was my first shot at creating a mobile application, an android one at that. Since I am also getting into web development, this project gave me some insight on 
the differences between the two. The most notable one was that creating and testing android applications felt slower since there was an emulator involved. The project structure 
was also a bit difficult to understand at first. Although I have worked with Java in the past, Java is more syntactically heavy and difficult to approach than Python or Javascript.
One thing that I felt was particularly difficult was the recycler view because alot of the rv logic was written by another developer. Now I've come to accept that you won't be 
able to understand everyone's code as a developer, however it's important to know how to use what you are given. One thing about android development that was interesting is 
the ability to click and drag buttons and other components. This was a small qol improvement and helps me to imagine the UI before hand. Overall this project taught me about what the
MVC, Model View Control, stood for and most importantly it demonstrated that I still have lots to learn and improve as a software engineer.
